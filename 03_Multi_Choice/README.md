The switch statement is almost the same as an “if statement”. 
The switch statement can have many conditions. 
You start the switch statement with a condition. 
If one of the variable equals the condition, the instructions are executed. 
It is also possible to add a default. 
If none of the variable equals the condition the default will be executed. 

switch...case only works with integer, character and enumeration constants.
